The HoverCard component can be used to display additional information when a user hovers over an element. It is useful for showing tooltips, additional details, or any other content that should be revealed on hover.

## Component Structure

```rust
// The HoverCard component wraps the trigger element and the content that will be displayed on hover.
HoverCard {
    HoverCardTrigger {
        // Anything inside the trigger (icon, text, rich markup) acts as the hover target.
        {children}
    }
    HoverCardContent {
        side: ContentSide::Bottom,
        align: ContentAlign::Start,
        {children}
    }
}
```

## No click-only mode

Unlike the menus (`NavigationMenu`, `Navbar`, `Menubar` and the dropdown /
context menu submenus), which take an `open_on_hover` prop to switch hover
off, a hover card has no such option: hovering (or focusing) the trigger *is*
what opens it, and its content is supplementary -- never the only way to reach
something. For a panel opened by a click, use [Popover](/component/popover/).
